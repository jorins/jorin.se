Equalisation, shortened to EQ, is the process of reducing, removing, or
boosting frequencies of a signal.

In electronic implementations, equalisation builds on filters combined with
volume boosts and cuts.

Digital implementations allow very peculiar and useful things, such as tilt-EQ
and dynamic EQ.
