title: Bass Tone
---

This page is a WIP, being written for my own amusement and patche's benefit. Shoutout to patche's dog.

Bass tone is a beautiful subject. It carries infinite nuance for those with ears to hear it. It is simultaneously well explored and criminally unexplored. This is my attempt to document it from a doom metal bassist's perspective.

Some things to note:

1. This is written from my own perspective with my own biases and artistic preferences.
2. For most of this document, I'll be referring to amplifiers, analogue amplifier emulators, and digital amplifier models as just amplifiers. Likewise, I will not make a distinction between physical speaker cabinets or impulse responses. See [[#Analogue vs Digital]] for why and my personal preferences in those matters.

# Designing a tone

There's naturally no one way to design a good bass tone, but there's some level of consensus around the process. This consensus is derived from a mix of historical necessities and reliable methodology. It generally looks something like this, from start to finished product:

1. Get as good a sound as you can out of the instrument
2. Gently compress the signal to shape dynamics
3. Shape the signal as needed using EQ
4. Apply drive effects
5. Apply modulation effects
6. Amplify
7. Capture through a cabinet

In a studio setting, you will reasonably also

1. Apply bus effects
2. Mix in the context of the full mix
3. Master the full track
   Which is a bit beyond the scope of my expertise, but important nonetheless.

All of these steps are of course optional, and their order is entirely up to you. Let them serve you instead of you serving them. Music is art, and your goal should be to understand the tools to pursue your artistic vision.

## A note on less is more

It cannot be said enough when it comes to bass tone that less is more. An under-processed bass will almost always at least sit decently in the mix and do its job. An over-processed bass will feel out of place. While I detest the notion that the bass should be strictly felt and not heard, it still needs to feel good before it can sound good. Legendary Motown bassist James Jamerson allegedly plugged his bass directly into the mixer and that is plenty enough for most genres, from Motown to technical death metal. Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols was so minimalist in his approach that he wasn't even plugged in for some gigs. If your bass tone feels off and you don't know why, the easiest fix is likely going back to basics. Cut back on effects. Review your play style and technique. Make it feel good, _then_ make it sound good.

**Know your artistic vision. Don't lose track of your artistic vision. Serve your artistic vision.**

## Instrument tone

The number one way to get a good tone out of your instrument is to improve your technique, because basses have been built virtually the same for the last fifty years and even cheap instruments nowadays are perfectly capable of outputting good tones in the right hands. This is not to say that you shouldn't mind your instrument. There's a lot to be said about instruments, but they all have more in common than they have in common't, so be wary of ending up splitting hairs for five hours a day on niche internet communities.

### String type

Among the most important choices for tone you can make is the type of strings you use. You can make distinctions between different string materials, but what weighs by far the most is the construction type. There's primarily three types of strings: round wound strings, flat wound strings, and tape wound strings.

#### Round wound strings

Rounds are by far the most popular type of string in the modern day thanks to their cheapness and their versatility. They provide a good bit of high end that allows them to cut through dense mixes and be heard in highly busy music. To tame them, you can just roll back your highs a bit and you will get something that sits more in the background and approximates the sound of flat wounds. Or you can use them for a while, and they will lose a lot of that sharp high end.

#### Flat wound strings

Flats were historically the most common type of string many a moon ago. They provide a more comfortable playing experience and tend to last longer. A lot of people think they even sound better with age. Haters will say that they are obsolete because you can approximate their sound by just rolling back your tone knob with rounds, but true believers understand that flats have a different kind of presence in the mid-range and that is what makes them desirable.

Rather paradoxically, flats sit well in a power trio with the right approach. You'd think you want to make use of a larger frequency range (and you do), but you can also refocus on taking up space in the mid-range normally occupied by the second guitar. This helps you achieve a very bass-led kind of sound akin to [[#Geezer Butler]] and [[#Al Cisneros]].

Flat wound strings are immune to slap bass. You can use this to your advantage by incorporating slap as a stim to keep your focus while playing without anyone noticing. Slapping flats is also a good way to just get the same kinda sound as plucking really hard, so don't be afraid to incorporate it into your playing as a means to an end, even if it sounds nothing like the archetypal slap sound.

#### Tape wound strings

I don't know anything about tape wound strings, please stop calling my number.

### Pickups

Pickups are also crucial in your tone. For starters, you won't get any sound without them. I think pickups are best understood by listening to them because any attempt to describe them is pretty silly and full of onomatopoeia. So here we go with a few pickup archetypes:

#### Precision pickup

A precision pickup, as found in a precision bass, is a split coil pickup. It's the most recorded type of pickup with good reason. As used in a precision bass, it has a very well rounded low-end response that helps it sit well in most conventional mixes combined with a "zing" that helps it cut through the mix without being ear-piercingly sharp.

#### Jazz pickup

Jazz pickups are single coil pickups and usually come in pairs. They're frequently described as "burpy", "honky", and other questionable things. They can be a bit more pronounced in the mids than precision pickups. I personally don't like them much, but countless people do.

#### PJ

A PJ bass uses both a [[#Precision pickup]] in the neck position and a [[#Jazz pickup]] in the bridge position. This is a bit of a best of both worlds situation that offers more versatility than just one of the two. Unless you are a purist, this is probably the ideal bass to achieve most classic bass sounds.

#### Double humbuckers

Double humbuckers are very commonly used in modern basses (i.e. starting with the 80's or so). They provide a very wide frequency response which when combined with a pre-amp allows them to sound like almost anything. But they can also do their own thing, which is to say amazingly heavy sub-bass that is prominent in modern forms of music and very sharp highs. Double humbuckers are probably the way to go for any bass unless you have a clear idea for something else that you want. Their versatility is simply unmatched.

#### Single humbucker

Single humbucker basses with just a bridge pickup were popularised in the 90's in combination with active on-board pre-amps. They provide _really_ sharp highs which was popular for slap styles of playing. The most famous model is the Music Man Stingray, most famously played by Tim Commerford (Rage Against The Machine) and Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers). I don't see any reason to use one over a double humbucker bass, but I'm sure someone better informed can tell you why.

### Electronics

There's not all that much to be said about bass electronics. Unlike guitar, they tend to be very standardised. For passive basses, you usually get per-pickup volume and tone control. For active basses, you get that in addition to some form of active EQ. My preference is for passive basses as I don't want to put lipstick on a pig. The pig is beautiful as it is. But that also means I don't know too much about the intricacies of active basses.

When recording a passive bass for clean tones, you mostly want to have your tone knob at max. If you need to make cuts to your highs, it's easier to do so in post. Likewise, if your volume doesn't affect any gain staging things, it's best to keep it cranked to maximise the signal to noise ratio. Not to mention that if you are recording with a compressor early in the signal chain, your volume knob will affect how the compressor responds so it's again probably better to run max volume into the compressor to keep its response consistent.

Recording dirty bass is a somewhat different beast. If you're running extremely high gain, cutting a bit with the tone knob can help reduce amplified noise without really affecting the end signal. And just like with guitars, the volume pushing into any dirt will affect its overall response. So you may want to roll back your tone a tiny bit, and you definitely want to work with gain staging to get your dirt to respond as you wish it to. But the same caveats with regards to early signal chain compression apply, so if you're running a compressor you should run max volume on your bass and set your overall volume into the dirt thereafter.

I don't have much guidance on dialling in an active bass in particular. It's the same as dialling in any pre-amp with EQ. One thing to bear in mind with active electronics is that you don't want to end up having them fight the rest of your gear, or fighting your engineer. I've heard stories of bassists changing their on-board EQ mid set and the sound engineer having to reverse that at the board. You can end up making boosts on your bass that you then cut on your amp. If you aren't certain what you're doing with an active bass, my only advice would be to keep it flat. There's simply more room to screw up with active EQ.

### Scale length, tuning, and string tension

Scale length, tuning, and string tension make a triangle. Increase pitch, and string tension increases. Increase scale length, and pitch drops. A lower tuning will require a longer scale length unless you want extremely thick strings. My personal opinion is that 35" is fine for a B tuning, maybe A standard, but once you start going lower you probably want to start going longer. My bass is 35" and has a G0 at 0.170" string gauge, and that's really pushing the boundaries of what can be done at that scale length. However, a longer scale length kind of lessens the effect of a low tuning, so I'm not a fan of the 40+" scale length basses because they don't drastically alter the timbre of the instrument despite being tuned down a full octave.

Toan wood is not real. Toan wood will not save you.

#### Finish

Nitrocellulose finish is the gold-plated optical cables of the guitar world.

Here's a few noteworthy bassist who have influenced me a lot.

## Geezer Butler

Butler, best known as the bassist of Black Sabbath, is the grandfather of metal bass. His style is noteworthy for his very bass-forward style, seldom following the guitar except for when the whole band does total monophonic unity for those really hard hitting riffs. Although his tone is well-revered, it's quite simple and derives more from playing style than from gear. Using a P or PJ bass with either flatwounds or well worn roundwounds, he plays hard well up on the neck of the bass. This puts a very strong emphasis on the lower frequencies. He used a cocked wah for the intro of N.I.B. by ~~mistake~~ happy accident, but is otherwise not known to be much of a pedal enthusiast.

## Peter Steele

Steele is best known as the vocalist and bassist of gothic/doom metal band Type O Negative. Although he wasn't particularly known for his play style, he had a very peculiar and appreciated tone achieved through his stacking of dirt and chorus effects. Since Type O Negative only employed one guitarist, he had a lot of sonic space to work with which permitted the use of such fuzzy sounds. A quick way to achieve a similar tone to him is to run an overdrive before _and_ after a chorus effect. He is also one of few bassists who employed a sustainer. It's not necessarily all that noticeable though, but perhaps that's the beauty of it.

## Al Cisneros

Cisneros is best known as the singer and bassist of Sleep and of Om. He is well known for playing Rickenbackers (even receiving his own signature model in 2019) with flatwound strings. During the late Sleep and early Om years, he used gigantic stacks of Green Matamps. Other tricks up his sleeve include the [[#Rick-o-sound]] as well as stacking a [[#Boss DS-1]] and [[#DOD 250]] (order uncertain) during his early Om years for that iconic "tripping balls in a record store" tone[^al-trips-balls]. Nowadays, he uses mostly what's readily available. Last I saw him around 2021 or so with Om, he was using a Darkglass Alpha Omega as his drive through an Ampeg amp.

His play style is very similar to his personal saviour [[#Geezer Butler]], perhaps playing even harder. Whereas his approach to bass lines in Sleep is very much like Butler's bass-forward lines in Sabbath, the playing field in Om requires him to keep the groove more on his own as there's no guitar backing him up in the riff for most songs, and he also stands for the full frequency spectrum.
