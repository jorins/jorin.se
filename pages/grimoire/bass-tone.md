title: Bass Tone
---

This page is a WIP, being written for my own amusement and patche's benefit. Shoutout to patche's dog.

Bass tone is a beautiful subject. It carries infinite nuance for those with ears to hear it. It is simultaneously well explored and criminally unexplored. This is my attempt to document it from a doom metal bassist's perspective.

# Disclaimers

1. This is written from my own perspective with my own biases and artistic preferences.
2. For most of this document, I'll be referring to amplifiers, analogue amplifier emulators, and digital amplifier models as just amplifiers. Likewise, I will not make a distinction between physical speaker cabinets or impulse responses. See [[#Analogue vs Digital]] and [[#Tubes vs Transistors]] for why and my personal preferences in those matters.
3. Most of this advice is hopefully applicable to other forms of sound design as well. Primarily guitars, which technologically overlap a lot with basses. However, I don't know the first thing about how to mic a trumpet or how to
4. A lot of this document has yet not been reviewed, not by myself and not by my peers. Some of it was written while I had a fever.
5. I am a habitual clown with a relatively dry sense of humour. I try to keep the joker inside of me muzzled but I cannot contain her forever. Hopefully the jokes are pretty obvious and help make my point, but if something is unclear as a result of poor attempts at humour, I'd love to hear that feedback if you can be bothered reaching out.

# Designing a tone

There's naturally no one way to design a good bass tone, but there's some level of consensus around the process. This consensus is derived from a mix of historical necessities and reliable methodology. It generally looks something like this, from start to finished product:

1. Get as good a sound as you can out of the instrument
2. Gently compress the signal to shape dynamics
3. Shape the signal as needed using EQ
4. Apply drive effects
5. Apply modulation effects
6. Amplify
7. Capture through a cabinet

In a studio setting, you will reasonably also

1. Apply bus effects
2. Mix in the context of the full mix
3. Master the full track
   Which is a bit beyond the scope of my expertise, but important nonetheless.

All of these steps are of course optional, and their order is entirely up to you. Let them serve you instead of you serving them. Music is art, and your goal should be to understand the tools to pursue your artistic vision.

## A note on less is more

It cannot be said enough when it comes to bass tone that less is more. An under-processed bass will almost always at least sit decently in the mix and do its job. An over-processed bass will feel out of place. While I detest the notion that the bass should be strictly felt and not heard, it still needs to feel good before it can sound good. Legendary Motown bassist James Jamerson allegedly plugged his bass directly into the mixer and that is plenty enough for most genres, from Motown to technical death metal. Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols was so minimalist in his approach that he wasn't even plugged in for some gigs. If your bass tone feels off and you don't know why, the easiest fix is likely going back to basics. Cut back on effects. Review your play style and technique. Make it feel good, _then_ make it sound good.

**Know your artistic vision. Don't lose track of your artistic vision. Serve your artistic vision.**

## Instrument tone

The number one way to get a good tone out of your instrument is to improve your technique, because basses have been built virtually the same for the last fifty years and even cheap instruments nowadays are perfectly capable of outputting good tones in the right hands. This is not to say that you shouldn't mind your instrument. There's a lot to be said about instruments, but they all have more in common than they have in common't, so be wary of ending up splitting hairs for five hours a day on niche internet communities.

### String type

Among the most important choices for tone you can make is the type of strings you use. You can make distinctions between different string materials, but what weighs by far the most is the construction type. There's primarily three types of strings: round wound strings, flat wound strings, and tape wound strings.

#### Round wound strings

Rounds are by far the most popular type of string in the modern day thanks to their cheapness and their versatility. They provide a good bit of high end that allows them to cut through dense mixes and be heard in highly busy music. To tame them, you can just roll back your highs a bit and you will get something that sits more in the background and approximates the sound of flat wounds. Or you can use them for a while, and they will lose a lot of that sharp high end.

#### Flat wound strings

Flats were historically the most common type of string many a moon ago. They provide a more comfortable playing experience and tend to last longer. A lot of people think they even sound better with age. Haters will say that they are obsolete because you can approximate their sound by just rolling back your tone knob with rounds, but true believers understand that flats have a different kind of presence in the mid-range and that is what makes them desirable.

Rather paradoxically, flats sit well in a power trio with the right approach. You'd think you want to make use of a larger frequency range (and you do), but you can also refocus on taking up space in the mid-range normally occupied by the second guitar. This helps you achieve a very bass-led kind of sound akin to [[#Geezer Butler]] and [[#Al Cisneros]].

Flat wound strings are immune to slap bass. You can use this to your advantage by incorporating slap as a stim to keep your focus while playing without anyone noticing. Slapping flats is also a good way to just get the same kinda sound as plucking really hard, so don't be afraid to incorporate it into your playing as a means to an end, even if it sounds nothing like the archetypal slap sound.

#### Tape wound strings

I don't know anything about tape wound strings, please stop calling my number.

### Pickups

Pickups are also crucial in your tone. For starters, you won't get any sound without them. I think pickups are best understood by listening to them because any attempt to describe them is pretty silly and full of onomatopoeia. So here we go with a few pickup archetypes:

#### Precision pickup

A precision pickup, as found in a precision bass, is a split coil pickup. It's the most recorded type of pickup with good reason. As used in a precision bass, it has a very well rounded low-end response that helps it sit well in most conventional mixes combined with a "zing" that helps it cut through the mix without being ear-piercingly sharp.

#### Jazz pickup

Jazz pickups are single coil pickups and usually come in pairs. They're frequently described as "burpy", "honky", and other questionable things. They can be a bit more pronounced in the mids than precision pickups. I personally don't like them much, but countless people do.

#### PJ

A PJ bass uses both a [[#Precision pickup]] in the neck position and a [[#Jazz pickup]] in the bridge position. This is a bit of a best of both worlds situation that offers more versatility than just one of the two. Unless you are a purist, this is probably the ideal bass to achieve most classic bass sounds.

#### Double humbuckers

Double humbuckers are very commonly used in modern basses (i.e. starting with the 80's or so). They provide a very wide frequency response which when combined with a pre-amp allows them to sound like almost anything. But they can also do their own thing, which is to say amazingly heavy sub-bass that is prominent in modern forms of music and very sharp highs. Double humbuckers are probably the way to go for any bass unless you have a clear idea for something else that you want. Their versatility is simply unmatched.

#### Single humbucker

Single humbucker basses with just a bridge pickup were popularised in the 90's in combination with active on-board pre-amps. They provide _really_ sharp highs which was popular for slap styles of playing. The most famous model is the Music Man Stingray, most famously played by Tim Commerford (Rage Against The Machine) and Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers). I don't see any reason to use one over a double humbucker bass, but I'm sure someone better informed can tell you why.

### Electronics

There's not all that much to be said about bass electronics. Unlike guitar, they tend to be very standardised. For passive basses, you usually get per-pickup volume and tone control. For active basses, you get that in addition to some form of active EQ. My preference is for passive basses as I don't want to put lipstick on a pig. The pig is beautiful as it is. But that also means I don't know too much about the intricacies of active basses.

When recording a passive bass for clean tones, you mostly want to have your tone knob at max. If you need to make cuts to your highs, it's easier to do so in post. Likewise, if your volume doesn't affect any gain staging things, it's best to keep it cranked to maximise the signal to noise ratio. Not to mention that if you are recording with a compressor early in the signal chain, your volume knob will affect how the compressor responds so it's again probably better to run max volume into the compressor to keep its response consistent.

Recording dirty bass is a somewhat different beast. If you're running extremely high gain, cutting a bit with the tone knob can help reduce amplified noise without really affecting the end signal. And just like with guitars, the volume pushing into any dirt will affect its overall response. So you may want to roll back your tone a tiny bit, and you definitely want to work with gain staging to get your dirt to respond as you wish it to. But the same caveats with regards to early signal chain compression apply, so if you're running a compressor you should run max volume on your bass and set your overall volume into the dirt thereafter.

I don't have much guidance on dialling in an active bass in particular. It's the same as dialling in any pre-amp with EQ. One thing to bear in mind with active electronics is that you don't want to end up having them fight the rest of your gear, or fighting your engineer. I've heard stories of bassists changing their on-board EQ mid set and the sound engineer having to reverse that at the board. You can end up making boosts on your bass that you then cut on your amp. If you aren't certain what you're doing with an active bass, my only advice would be to keep it flat. There's simply more room to screw up with active EQ.

### Scale length, tuning, and string tension

Scale length, tuning, and string tension make a triangle. Increase pitch, and string tension increases. Increase scale length, and pitch drops. A lower tuning will require a longer scale length unless you want extremely thick strings. My personal opinion is that 35" is fine for a B tuning, maybe A standard, but once you start going lower you probably want to start going longer. My bass is 35" and has a G0 at 0.170" string gauge, and that's really pushing the boundaries of what can be done at that scale length. However, a longer scale length kind of lessens the effect of a low tuning, so I'm not a fan of the 40+" scale length basses because they don't drastically alter the timbre of the instrument despite being tuned down a full octave.

## Getting a good clean tone

Once you like what you're hearing coming out of the instrument, there's a couple of common touch ups you can do. First is compression, to help alter your dynamics. Generally, the way to approach this is to try to even out your dynamics a bit to reduce inconsistencies in your attack. No matter how well practised you are, you will have some degree of variation. While a tiny bit is a good thing to have, a compressor can help you play more comfortably. I won't get into the details of how to set up a compressor here because there's simply other resources that can explain it better.

My approach to early compression is to run heavy compression with input blend. This is sometimes known as L.A. style compression, or parallel compression. This allows you to keep most of your attack dynamics intact, while smoothing out and prolonging sustain. This is very helpful for doom metal, especially with instruments and rigs that don't sustain too well.

After compressing, you might want to add some EQ to compensate for things you don't quite like about your dry tone. Subtlety is key, it's seldom you want to adjust more than a few dBs. If we divide the spectrum up by three bands like most EQs will provide, we've got bass, mids, and treble. These bands can of course be divided further, but you're better off consulting a dedicated engineer than a bassist if you're going that far. What should you do with each band?

- **Bass**: bass is the part of the spectrum that is perhaps more so felt than heard. So dial after feeling. Make sure your instrument is actually felt. Just make sure that the feeling doesn't overpower what you're saying.
- **Mids:** mids are where your instrument is really heard. Cutting your mids sounds cool in isolation, but it sounds terrible in the context of most mixes. Turning them up too much can be a bit overbearing though. High mids is the stuff toddler screams are made of and we're fine tuned by nature to react strongly to them.[^toddlers]
- **Treble:** treble will make your sound hip and cool and fresh. You should absolutely have some, they're basically a shortcut for achieving a modern sound. Conversely, cutting them makes you sound more vintage. They contribute a lot to moving the bass into the foreground, so be mindful of whether that's something you want to achieve.

[^toddlers]: I don't have a source for this and I'm not going to bother finding one because it fits my preconceived perception of reality.

Once your clean tone is good, it's ready to record for most music. But if you're bothering reading this, you probably aren't one for pure clean tones. Make no mistake that you should achieve a good clean tone regardless. It'll hone your ability as a bassist, you'll probably want it in some songs even if you play the heaviest music you've ever heard, it'll be helpful as a foundation for dirt, and having a solid clean tone to mix with is a godsend.

## Adding effects

## Wrapping it up

## Studio considerations

# Analogue vs Digital

This is always a heated subject prone to misinformation. It gets harder and harder to argue against digital modelling for each year that passes as models get more powerful and more accurate.

Here's the things digital can do perfectly that I will not argue about:

- Linear delay and reverb
- Speaker simulation
- EQ
- Compression

Here's the things that digital can do almost perfectly that can be argued about, but I will not be bothered:

- Modulation effects
- Non-linear delay and reverb

The primary realm where analogue still serves some purpose is the realm of dirt. I still like analogue for a few very specific reasons:

1. Analogue doesn't place limits on my volume that'll result in harsh clipping. Instead, I can get cool sounds if I push more volume into my units.
2. Digital dirt modellers, even the fancier units, have some remaining tendency to produce digital artefacts. This is generally a non-issue that a listener is unlikely to notice, but I play music for my own enjoyment and it harshes my vibe.
3. Twisting real knobs is a lot more fun than using your mouse to turn a digital dial, using an app on your phone, or diving into nested menus.
4. The endless possibilities of digital models often have little to offer other than option paralysis.

## Real amps, fake cabs

Impulse response based cab sims are pretty much perfectly accurate. Even if you insist on running real amps, it is my unprofessional opinion that you should still grab a DI signal coming out of the power amp for the purpose of adding a cab sim. Capturing cabinets is not an easy task, nor a cheap one. I personally proudly shill for [Dr. Bonkers](https://www.drbonkerssoundlab.com/) without receiving any compensation. He has captured loads of rare and interesting cabinets, in addition to a lot of standard ones.

It is worth noting that impulse responses are not capable of capturing non-linear behaviours of cabs. However, if your cab is responding non-linearly, you're pushing it too hard and are risking serious damage to it. This is fine if you are Lemmy, but Lemmy is dead and no rock or metal bassist can generate enough revenue to chew through cabinets at that rate without risking bankruptcy.

# Tubes vs Transistors

Like today's analogue vs digital bickering, arguing about tubes and transistors was all the rage in the past. Tubes are certainly cool, but they weigh a boatload, cost another boatload, require a third boatload of maintenance, and can't be played at high gain without a fourth boatload of volume. So transistor amplifiers became really popular when they started becoming loud enough to compete with tubes, to the dismay of many tube purists who were born in the 70's but got somehow got stuck in the 60's. What's more noteworthy than the choice of tubes or transistors is probably the circuit design itself though. It's useless bickering about subjective things with moving goalposts. Use your ears to determine what you think sounds good.

I really like a lot of historical tube amps, but I don't particularly care for breaking my back or my bank. So I use JFET-based emulations of the amps I like. It's taken the pedal designers some time to get there, but the modern ones integrate proper power-amp emulation to improve accuracy. To me, they sound really close to the real deal and give me most of the pros of a proper amp without the drawbacks of digital models.

# Low-end response and blending

This section primarily concerns pedals. Some studio gear may be affected too though. Guitars have a limited range, a limited frequency response, and pretty typical sounds. Pedal designers can use these properties to their advantages, whereas designers of other studio gear generally have to make their units fit for high-fidelity applications.

## Why pedals cut your lows

Most pedals are designed for guitar, which in standard tuning has its lowest pitch at about 80Hz. Mains voltage is usually 50Hz or 60Hz and it has a sneaking tendency to add noise to your signal path. A great way to keep your pedal noise free is to just filter out these lows. It won't necessarily get everything, but it's a pretty surefire way to improve the performance of a pedal at large.

Similarly, a problem a lot of dirt pedals have is that the fundamental frequency becomes very dominant in the sound. When you clip the top and bottom of a signal, it adds harmonics and that's how we usually get distortion effects. Unfortunately, some of the nuance of the input harmonics is lost if the fundamental frequency just has the output swinging between minimum and maximum, essentially producing a square wave. For this reason, good management of bass frequencies is crucial to making dirt pedals that don't just sound the same. Most pedals will therefore employ a series of low-end cuts to perfect their sound.

## Resulting issues and immediate solutions

With these two things in mind, it's easy to see why a lot of pedals, especially dirt pedals, perform poorly with bass. They cut your precious bass frequencies! Usually, this is fine. You can turn up your bass knob a tiny bit if you feel the need to compensate. Sometimes it's not fine. If you're playing through five pedals that all cause a little bit of low-end loss, you're suddenly seeing the life sucked out of your performance. If you tune lower, these cuts become even more extreme as you slide further down the filter slopes.

This issue can kind of be solved with a clean blend. Combining the affected, tone-sucked signal with your original signal will restore your original bass response. Even if the offending pedal itself doesn't have a clean blend built into it, there's a lot of utility pedals that allow you to blend your clean signal with an affected pedal. The Boss LS-2 is a popular choice for this.

An even fancier solution is to use a crossover filter to split your signal before the offending effects. For example, you might split your signal into highs and lows around 300Hz, send the highs into an effect, and then recombine the affected signal with the unaffected lows. This ideally provides more cohesion to the signal than a plain clean blend. Whereas a regular clean blend will receive highs from both your input signal and your affected signal resulting in a sound that can sound very clearly stacked, a crossover guarantees that you're only receiving highs and lows from one place each.

This might make a crossover sound like an objectively better solution, but regular blending can still be an amazing tool. For example, if you're running your signal through a fuzz pedal, you are sure to lose a lot of dynamics as fuzzes compress your signal very hard. Either type of blending will help restore some of your attack and make your sound more punchy, but a clean blend that also contains the highs of your input signal will do so more than a crossover.

With regards to using it with dirt, plain clean blend is more of a 2000's rock sound (e.g. Chris Wolstenholme of Muse) whereas crossover blending has become more popular in the 2010's extreme metal, especially popularised by [Nolly Getgood of Periphery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2smB0p8P-GQ) and [Darkglass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee8JOMB7oSc).

## Limitations of blending solutions

Blends are great solutions! And I don't like them much at all! As a mixing tool, they're amazing. But they don't help me achieve the dirt sounds I want. If you think critically about what happens in a blended signal path with a poorly responding dirt pedal, the problem should become fairly obvious.

Let's say you play a low B. It has a fundamental frequency of about 30Hz, a second harmonic at 60Hz, and a third at 90Hz. These three harmonics account for a significant amount of your volume overall. You send this signal into a dirt effect with a low cut that cuts starting at 120Hz. The distortion circuit thus receives a decent bit of your third harmonic, much less of your second harmonic, and virtually none of your fundamental frequency. What it's receiving will amount to a fraction of the volume that you tried to put in and there won't be much distortion going on. If you then go up two octaves, your fundamental frequency is at 120Hz and none of your signal is being cut when it goes into the distortion. It gets properly distorted.

When you blend this dirt effect with your clean input, what you effectively get is dirt that only applies when you play higher notes. This can be a good thing. It makes your signal very manageable and adds contrast between your registers. But it can also make your lower notes sound flaccid and impotent in comparison. The solution to this is generally to just use better designed dirt. Distorting bass amps tends to be a premier source of solid dirty lows. You can also mod dirt pedals to reduce their filtering of the lows. Replacing a capacitor can be enough.

# Anti-toanchaser propaganda

For every good advice on the internet, there's ten certifiably terrible ideas circulated in the darkest pits of Reddit comments. I think it's good to know of a few things that absolutely don't make sense and should be laughed at. After all, you will not be a successful toan chaser if you spend your days chasing lies.

## "Toan wood is totally real"

Toan wood is not real. Toan wood will not save you. Any change it makes amounts to an increase by 0.01% Toan Points™ at most. Toan Wood believers should be immediately converted the religion they'll use to inflict the least harm possible on their immediate surroundings.

## "Finish affects toan"

Nitrocellulose finish is the gold-plated optical cables of the guitar world. Your instrument doesn't have a more "open" sound because you can see the wood grain better. You should have an instrument that looks as cool as possible so that you can get laid if you play any shows, as you'll sorely need the external body heat to make it through the cold night if you are a gigging musician.

## "Toan is in the fingers"

How you play your instrument absolutely affects how it sounds, but this phrase is copium spoken only by people who have never had their face blasted off by a cubed baker's dozen Model T's powering a total of eighteen billion speaker cones crying in agony.

## "Trust your ears"

A phrase commonly spoken by snake oil enthusiasts who listen with their eyes and wallets. You should absolutely trust your ears in the sense that if it sounds better, it is better. However, a difference must be reproducible and measurable. There is no audio magic, there is only audio engineering and trustworthy engineers can back their claims up with measurements. Know the difference between someone saying that something sounds better because there is an audible difference that they like, and someone saying that something sounds better because they need to justify having spent half a month's wages on a pretty aluminium box that adds 0.5dB of gain.

## "10 inch speakers are treble-focused, 12 inch speakers are balanced, 15 inch speakers are bass-focused"

People like to think that bigger speaker means bassier sound. This may have some historical reason, or it may just be that they really want to arbitrarily categorise. The reality is that there is no guaranteed correlation between speaker size and frequency response thanks to the advances in speaker cone manufacturing and cabinet design over the last hundred or so years.

A great example of something that breaks these expectations is the [[#Ampeg 8×10]]. It's a very dark sounding cabinet despite using 10 inch cones. Conversely, there's no shortage of poor-performing, oversized cabs from the past that have their frequency response and volume alike outmatched by modern, well designed 1×10" cabs.

There's something to be said about marketing based on size to a demographic obsessed with measuring inches, but it more or less goes without saying. Rock and metal bassist have, especially historically, primarily been young men.

# Specific gear units

There's a lot of bass gear that is important, either for historical and cultural reasons, or because of my own preferences.

## Compressors

There's a lot to be said about different compressors. I've used a few and have some opinions, but you should refer to [Ovnilab](https://www.ovnilab.com/) for actual reviews. Although they haven't done reviews since 2018, their site is by far the greatest resource on bass compressors on the internet. There's been a few notable releases since. Empress released the second version of their compressor, and Darkglass replaced the Supersymmetry with the Hyper Luminal. But nothing fundamental has changed about compression.

### Electro-Harmonix Bass Preacher

The Bass Preacher was my first compressor. It's good for the price and is a pretty typical "gets the job done" compressor. I found it a little bit limited though, in particular because I wanted to do parallel compression to achieve more sustain.

### Empress Compressor v1

The Empress is an amazing compressor that is highly versatile. It has just the right amount of tone-sweetening. It is without a doubt the best analogue compressor I've used. If you're in the market for an analogue compressor and you're willing to shell out, I'd say the Empress is ideal. I haven't used the v2, but it should be more of the same good stuff.

### MXR M87 Bass Compressor

I got an MXR that I spent a little bit of time with, but not enough to evaluate it well. What I could tell was that I overall felt the Empress was easier to work with and sounded a bit better. Which is not to say the M87 is necessarily bad.

### Boss X-COMP model

I switched to digital models because I run a [[#Rick-o-sound]] and it was far more economical to do so through a modelling pedal, namely a Boss GT 1000 Core. And the Boss X-Comp model, which should be the same as (or at least pretty much the same as) the one found in the Boss BC-1X, is wonderful. It's overall very easy to dial in, doesn't have any notable noise floor, and the brightness control can add a nice sparkle. I think I still like the Empress a little bit more, but that's very likely just analogue copium.

## Octavers

Octavers are fun little things.

## Other effects

# Noteworthy bassists

Here's a few noteworthy bassists who have influenced me a lot, or otherwise deserve to be discussed for their influence on the industry from a perspective of tone.

## Geezer Butler

Butler, best known as the bassist of Black Sabbath, is the grandfather of metal bass. His style is noteworthy for his very bass-forward style, seldom following the guitar except for when the whole band does total monophonic unity for those really hard hitting riffs. Although his tone is well-revered, it's quite simple and derives more from playing style than from gear. Using a P or PJ bass with either flatwounds or well worn roundwounds, he plays hard well up on the neck of the bass. This puts a very strong emphasis on the lower frequencies. He used a cocked wah for the intro of N.I.B. by ~~mistake~~ happy accident, but is otherwise not known to be much of a pedal enthusiast.

## Peter Steele

Steele is best known as the vocalist and bassist of gothic/doom metal band Type O Negative. Although he wasn't particularly known for his play style, he had a very peculiar and appreciated tone achieved through his stacking of dirt and chorus effects. Since Type O Negative only employed one guitarist, he had a lot of sonic space to work with which permitted the use of such fuzzy sounds. A quick way to achieve a similar tone to him is to run an overdrive before _and_ after a chorus effect. He is also one of few bassists who employed a sustainer. It's not necessarily all that noticeable though, but perhaps that's the beauty of it.

## Al Cisneros

Cisneros is best known as the singer and bassist of Sleep and of Om. He is well known for playing Rickenbackers (even receiving his own signature model in 2019) with flatwound strings. During the late Sleep and early Om years, he used gigantic stacks of Green Matamps. Other tricks up his sleeve include the [[#Rick-o-sound]] as well as stacking a [[#Boss DS-1]] and [[#DOD 250]] (order uncertain) during his early Om years for that iconic "tripping balls in a record store" tone[^al-trips-balls]. Nowadays, he uses mostly what's readily available. Last I saw him around 2021 or so with Om, he was using a Darkglass Alpha Omega as his drive through an Ampeg amp.

His play style is very similar to his personal saviour [[#Geezer Butler]], perhaps playing even harder. Whereas his approach to bass lines in Sleep is very much like Butler's bass-forward lines in Sabbath, the playing field in Om requires him to keep the groove more on his own as there's no guitar backing him up in the riff for most songs, and he also stands for the full frequency spectrum.

[^al-trips-balls]: [Om live at Amoeba, a.k.a. Al Cisneros Tripping Balls on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jprlHifQCIM)

## Dylan Desmond

Desmond is the lead vocalist and bassist of funeral doom band Bell Witch. He plays with a lot of influences from classical music and creates amazingly cathartic music, mournful yet hopeful together with his collaborators.

Desmond's approach to tone is to split his signal by frequency into three bands, mimicking a death metal ensemble with two guitars and a bass. The gear itself isn't particularly noteworthy as he achieves pretty standard death/doom metal tones, but his success in this approach absolutely is. I have no doubt he will be viewed as one of, if not the most, influential metal bassist of the 2010's.

## Jo Bench

Bench is the bassist of death metal band Bolt Thrower. She's notable in that she uses some absolutely filthy tones to great effect. Her go-to method was bog-standard distortion into amplifier tones. What makes her unique, especially for her time, was that she had sense enough to use pedals that could achieve high gain without losing bass response or getting completely lost in the mix all the way back in the 80's and 90's. She's perhaps the most famous user of the [[#Ibanez PD7]], but has been known to use other pedals too.

## Jorin Seline

That's me! I think a rundown of my own primary rig and style is justified to contextualise this page. I run a Woodo X6 Black Ash tuned to G0 using Octave4Plus flats. The pickups are Nordstrand Big Blades (Warm & Woolly) and the electronics have been converted to a passive Rick-o-sound setup. This lets me do a dual tone approach with the neck pickup powering a Kuro Exegol (Sunn Model T emulation), while the bridge pickup runs into a Kuro T120 (Matamp GT120 emulation). It's nothing short of a huge sound and I quite frankly think it sounds better than anything else I've ever heard.

My inspirations for this include Al Cisneros, Dylan Desmond, Conan (the band), and Boris (also the band) among others. I wanted something that's massive, expressive, dynamic, and personal. I think I succeeded so far, but I am notoriously bad at actually completing music, which makes me a bedroom poser.
