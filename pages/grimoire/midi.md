MIDI is a protocol used to transmit data about musical events.

# Physical

A MIDI connector uses three pins: ground, +5V, and a data sink. It can be
used over five-pin DIN, TRS, TS, or purely digitally. Although not standardised
for a long while, manufacturers have used MIDI over TRS (most commonly 3.5mm)
for a long time. There are three TRS variants.

|         Pin function | DIN connector pin[^din-conn] | TRS A **(standard)** | TRS B  | TS / TRS C |
| -------------------: | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
|  Data (current sink) | 5                            | Tip                  | Ring   | Tip        |
| +5V (current source) | 4                            | Ring                 | Tip    | Sleeve     |
|               Ground | 2                            | Sleeve               | Sleeve | _None_     |

[^din-conn]: DIN connector does not use pin 1 or 3. Whack!
