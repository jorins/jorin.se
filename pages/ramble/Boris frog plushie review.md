**N.B.:** this review is pretty much done, but it's structurally a bit of a mess and I need to add pictures.

I'm a huge fan of [Boris](https://borisheavyrocks.com). [Amplifier Worship](https://boris.bandcamp.com/album/amplifier-worship) ranks among my favourite albums of all time. I even own the same statuette that was featured on the album cover. So while the band's own copies of the statuette weren't too appealing to me, the plushie combined two things I simply cannot get enough of: drone metal and snuggles. I'm not knowledgeable in fabrics or sewing, but I feel like I've gone through enough plushies in my life to be able to tell a little bit about their quality. And given that the average doom metal fan is a bearded guy in his 40's, I reckon I'm one of few people who would ever entertain the idea of openly talking about how it feels to hug this thing. So out of a sense of obligation, I figure I should review this thing.

# Purchase and shipping process

I ordered the little goober as soon as I saw it was available at [Merchtable](https://boris.merchtable.com/accessories/boris-froggy-plushie). The plushie itself cost me $40. Shipping to Sweden came out to $14. Import duties fees were about $20, for a total of $74. It was all handled very fast. The plushie came in an appropriately sized box without any stuffing. I suppose didn't need any considering it's all stuffing itself.

# Impressions

The plushie is absolutely gorgeous. The green fabric is extremely vibrant and soft to the touch. I don't know how to assess its quality, but it feels to me like it's quite reasonably dense. You can't really see the fabric under the fluff the way you can with some cheaper fluffy stuffed animals. The eyes are patches that are sewn on, similar to how IKEA plushies are done (e.g. BLÅHAJ). This makes for a more cartoonish design approach, which I think is a good choice given that it's an anthropomorphised animal. Even the nostrils are sewn with enough density that you can't see the fabric underneath them, which I think is a testament to pretty good craftsmanship and design.

All of the plushies innards are a single volume, with the exception of the legs. This lets them fold so it can sit up or stay while laying down or being held, which I suspect is the reason for separating them from the body. Sitting down, the plushie measures about 19cm or 7 inches. Held standing, it reaches about 30cm or 12 inches.

The arms feel more solid than the rest of the body or the head, I reckon they might hold a different kind of filling in order to avoid stuffing migrating up into the body. If you have had a BLÅHAJ for a longer time, you know how the fins get. I'd love to confirm whether that's the method used here, but I'm not too keen on dissecting this frog so I think time will have to tell instead.

There are some stuffing beads in the posterior which helps add some much needed weight. The plushie weighs 150 grams or about 5 ounces, about half of it being the head. I'd have preferred it a bit heavier, not only for the feeling of it but also to balance out the top heaviness.

The mouth contains solid pieces of something beneath the fabric to keep its shape. For better or worse, the plushie will never shut its mouth. This is incredibly cute but unfortunately it doesn't feel very nice to hug as hugging it mostly involves pressing these solid pieces into your collarbone. This is perhaps its biggest flaw to me.

# Many small issues

The first thing I noticed about the plushie is that it arrived with a hard fold in its tongue. The mouth has a hardened shape under the fabric to keep its shape, and so the tongue was stuck in the fold inside the mouth. I hope it will flatten out over time, but the tongue is bent upwards for the time being.

I had opted for the green collar version and the collar came in good shape overall. It's made from a felt fabric measuring about a millimeter thick. It feels like it's on the thin side in proportion to the rest of the plushie, and it might easily tear. There's a slight bend in one of the ends. The collar is fastened with velcro in the back. The strip of velcro used only measures 7 mm × 20 mm (1/4" × 3/4"). It's very small and I'd wager it'll age pretty poorly, at least if repeatedly opened. And once it fails, it's probably going to fail pretty hard as the collar is under a decent amount of tension as it is sat tightly around the neck.

The plushie is weighted a bit so as to be able to sit. However, the beads are in the buttocks region and combined with the legs making it lean back a bit, the balance is so fine that you can literally blow at it to knock it over.

None of these issues are in and of themselves deal breakers to me, but they all stack up and make me feel like it would take a very small step to turn this from a good plushie to an excellent plushie.

# Conclusion

I am positively whelmed by the plushie. The quality is decent, but not great. The craftsmanship stands out as quite high quality, but the materials and quality assurance leave a little bit to be desired. If it were any other plushie, I'd say it was overpriced. However, given the limited quantity and the fact that proceeds have to be split between Boris, the manufacturer, and the distributor, it feels like a reasonable price point. For a decorative plushie, materials and quality assurance are not quite on par with an authentic [fumo](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/FumoFumo). For a snuggling plushie, it has neither the shape nor ruggedness to be something I'd keep in my bed. But as a novelty plushie that reminds me of some of my favourite music of all time and I can give some gentle hugs, it's excellent. I'd rather have paid $10-$15 more for some higher quality materials and quality assurance, but I'd imagine I'm an outlier in thinking it was too cheap.
